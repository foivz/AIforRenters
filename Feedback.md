## PROJECT REVIEW
 
* IMPORTANT - I have seen that **project application form was changed recently**. If you have made important functional changes then please have in mind that that is allowed only in collaboration with a mentor. Thus, your changes might be not allowed. Of course, the additional explanations or typos corrections are always allowed.
 
## Project documentation
* The functionalities presented in project plan differ from those presented on application form and on the home page. There is one more chapter in SRS where the same table was used. This is probably related to above mentioned changes.
* There is some *lorem ipsum* text in your documentation :(
* No chapter should contain only an image without any introduction, explanation, and conclusion. However, no chapter should be text extensive either.
* DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK - 5-phase waterfall model proposed by teacher.
* PROJECT PLAN - It is creditable to have the plan adjusted with your chosen development framework.
* TEAM MEMBERS WORKLOAD PLAN - Please define a workload plan for each team member.
* SALES PROPOSAL (OFFER) - This is NOT OBLIGATORY for projects in cooperation with industry. If you would like to see how it looks you can check this example here: https://www.pandadoc.com/sales-proposal-template/
 
## Research documentation
* The theme, content and scope of this chapter is sufficient. However, it lacks the conclusion and explicit specification of chosen technology that would be prototyped and/or used in your solution. That chosen technology should be explained in more details, including the instructions on how to include/set it up in the solution.
 
## Technical documentation
* In general, I like your approach and structure of your technical documentation. Please put the author (responsible team member) beneath the title of each section in your documentation.  
* Please add to your data model a temporal component. This means that for example change in price will not affect any already written historical data.
* Please use graphical or table representation of data where applicable (e.g. chapter 6 of your SRS).
* The use case models are not defined in accordance to UML specification. Please correct UC diagrams.
* The enumeration and description of modules in chapter 2 of your SDS document should be reformatted in table view. Additionally, each module should be focused by a separate chapter and covered in detail.
* The class diagram could be divided into more specific class diagrams - each focusing on a specific topic in documentation.
* More UML should be used in your documentation in general.
* Please add chapter on development environment setup and user's test data (such as credentials etc.). There are different modules, so please cover all necessary instructions related to every module.
 
## Implementation
* As there is no source code in master branch, I have been observing the source code on the latest commit (on Keyword Extractor branch) only. You will know if some of the remarks are outdated as resolved or should be applied to other branches as well.  
* .gitignore is not set correctly. The repository should be clear after building and starting the app without any changes.
* The source code versioning is fine. However, I see that @zpecena is committing files via upload feature of GitHub. That would not be a good approach. Zdenko do you need help on staging and committing? If you want, you can check this out: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow.  
* In general, I am satisfied with the level of implementation of your app. The source code could be improved, cleaned, and refactored a little bit. Please do not forget to add appropriate summaries (comments) in your code.  
 
## Your score
F1: 13 points  
 
P.S. Please deal with issues on changing the application proposal as soon as possible. This is a serious issue that could be seen as cheating.
