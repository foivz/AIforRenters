## Domain description
The general idea of the system is to be able to automatically respond to the requests sent through different channels (e.g. web form, e-mail, ...) and to give an answer in regards with the property availability for the requested time slot. The availability is checked in the database, and if the time slot is not free the system should propose a different time slot. The system should provide the means of defining the response template in English language.

## Project specification
* Centralized database
* API to store and retrieve the data
* Module/s to receive requests from users
* AI module to send responses
* Desktop app to monitor the status and health of the system and requests made by users
* Mobile and/or web app (with similar features as the desktop one)
